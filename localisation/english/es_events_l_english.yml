rus.8.t: "Starting situation"
rus.8.desc: "A Russian invasion of Ukraine is imminent. The prehistory of the impending conflict began as early as 2013, when anti-Russian protests began across the country, resulting in the proclamation of the DNR and LNR in early 2014, which escalated into a full-fledged war in eastern Ukraine. Active hostilities continued until 2015, although local skirmishes between troops continued until 2022. On one side of the conflict is Russia, which wants to acquire the industrially developed and densely populated Donbass, as well as to protect the Russians living in the republics. On the other side of the conflict is Ukraine, which wants to regain control of the recalcitrant lands. What the coming year will bring us?" #чал
rus.8.a: "The year promises to be interesting"
rus.9.t: "Recognition of Luhansk and Donetsk People's Republics"
rus.9.desc: "Today President Vladimir Putin signed decrees recognizing the independence of the DPR and LPR. This means that the population of Donbass, over which the Kiev gang of Nazis scoffed for 8 years, did not rise in vain! From now on, the Russian Federation will begin to officially supply humanitarian and military assistance to the People's Republics, and under the agreement «On friendship, cooperation and mutual assistance between Russia and the DPR and LPR» Russia has every right to launch an invasion of Ukraine in order to ensure the protection and territorial integrity of the Donbass republics."

If we allow this, NATO will receive a large border with Russia, and the independence of our allies - Luhansk and Donetsk - will inevitably be eliminated. We can say with confidence that we cannot allow the expansion of the North Atlantic Alliance on the territory of Ukraine. Now is the time to take action."

smo.2.t: "Escalation"
smo.2.desc: "The inevitable escalation of the conflict is coming, to this day the conflict in Ukraine is a hybrid war, and in recent times there has been almost no fighting. But in mid-December, Russia put forward demands to NATO to stop supporting Ukraine and trying to include it in the alliance. These demands in NATO were considered unrealistic, and then they began to support Ukraine even more. In response to this, we can negotiate and try to reach an agreement, although, if they fail, escalation cannot be avoided. But there is another, more radical way in which we will start a full-scale war with Ukraine. So, it remains to decide what we will choose?"

Quite unexpectedly, the hour was already late. \n— Yes, yes, I'm listening.. \n— Alexander Grigorievich, you have a call from the Kremlin, straight from Vladimir Putin. \n— Connect... \nA call from the Kremlin?

Once upon a time the whole country used to come here for vacation and one of the largest enterprises of Ukraine - Azovstal - used to work here. Only memories are left from all this. \nAfter the events in Donbass in 2014, the city was temporarily occupied by DNR forces, but they were eventually dislodged and did not appear in the city until recent events. With the start of the Russo-Ukrainian war, Mariupol became a priority target for the Russian Armed Forces and DNR forces. The city is an important corridor that connects Crimea with Russia by land, and it had an important symbolic meaning as the place where Donbass separatism was stopped. \nIn a matter of days, the Russian army was able to get close to the city. The forces of the Civil Defense, police, National Guard, and AFU prevented them from entering the city, so they began methodical shelling of Mariupol. \nGradually, the forces of the city's defenders weakened. District after district was occupied by Russian Armed Forces units, fighting was literally going on for every house. Experts estimate that 90% of Mariupol's housing stock was destroyed.During the city's battles, numerous war crimes were committed - the shelling of the Mariupol maternity hospital, the city hospital and the Drama Theater. The latter episode is rightly considered one of the bloodiest in the war. According to various sources, several hundred city residents, including elderly people and children, were left under the rubble of the Drama Theater. Meanwhile, each side shifts the blame for what happened to the other. International organizations, such as the OSCE, claim that Russia is to blame, providing irrefutable evidence.. \nAfter a long period of fighting, the last defenders of Mariupol were trapped in the remnants of Azovstal. The huge basement complexes beneath the combine allowed for a long defense, but the Ukrainian soldiers suffered from a lack of supplies and inadequate medical care. \nEventually, as agreed by the parties, these men were withdrawn outside Azovstal and surrendered to the Russian army. Their fate remains to be seen. In the meantime, the city is completely under the power of Russia and the DNR administration."

Our priority now is to restore stability and order to the city, and to find the active supporters of the neo-Nazi regime.

The opinions of the generals on this issue are completely polarized. Some officials believe that we need to stop attacking the positions of the Armed Forces of Ukraine and stop wasting men. Instead, wait for their counteroffensive, destroy their best troops and to resume attacks on their positions.

The Russian Federation has been concentrating its land forces on its border with Ukraine, possibly preparing for a full-scale land invasion of the country. In light of this, President Vladimir Putin demanded so-called “security guarantees” for the Federation. Said guarantees include the complete abandonment of our military bases in Eastern Europe and a ban on Ukraine and Georgia from joining NATO. Of course, most of Russia’s demands are unacceptable.

ukr.7.t: "Unrest in Eastern Ukraine"
ukr.7.desc: "The SBU reports about the growing discontent and a wave of mass protests in the east of our country. Citizens are dissatisfied with the ongoing political, military and economic crisis, but this is not the only reason for the protests. According to our information, agents of the Russian secret services are intentionally stirring up the local more or less pro-Russian Ukrainians. Bribery, sabotage, and false-flag operations are all more than one item of action by these "saboteurs." The discontent of the population has not yet reached a critical point. But if we turn a blind eye to this, it will soon be more than just the LDNR that will be under Russian control."
ukr.7.a: "Just Act"
ukr.12.t: "Heavy burden"
ukr.12.desc: "Since Euromaidan and the Russian invasion of Crimea and Donbass, Ukraine's position has been incredibly precarious. Over the years we have managed to nullify the conflict in the east of our country, establish cooperation with Western countries and even make some compromises with Putin. But now more than ever, it is impossible to predict the actions of Russia and its regime."
ukr.12.a: "What should we do?"
ukr.13.t: "The clouds are gathering"
ukr.13.desc: "We are on the threshold of a new Russian invasion. It is pointless to deny what the U.S. intelligence services and leadership are telling us. It is only unclear how the intervention will take place. Where Putin's army will strike and whether war will be declared, what will happen to the separatists in Donbass... All that remains for our leadership and country is just to prepare. We must defend our independence and freedom."
ukr.13.a: "And who will help us?"
ukr.14.t: "A ray of light in the darkness"
ukr.14.desc: "The main thing is that we are not alone. Behind us is the entire Western and civilized world, which knows that Putin's Russia is the aggressor. They can be led by the nose, subjugate their economies to cheap oil from Russia, but they will never stay away from Ukraine. Unlike us, Putin has no real allies, and no one will help him in the future confrontation. Victory will be ours, for we are the whole world."
ukr.14.a: "Forward, Ukraine!"
ukr.15.t: "Convening of the NSDC"
ukr.15.desc: "This is a critical moment for the fate of Ukraine. The National Security Council must build a definite strategy to resolve our growing conflict with Russia.

ukr.17.desc: "Urgent news comes from near Kiev. The Russian Armed Forces have landed several groups of paratroopers at Gostomel airport and have already managed to capture this strategically important point. Local militia and AFU fighters are already trying to dislodge the enemy from there, but if we do not take more active steps, Russian paratroopers may entrench right outside our capital."
ukr.17.a: "Do your best!"
ukr.22.t: "Massacre in Bucha"
ukr.22.desc: "After the retreat of the Russian Army from Bucha, a small town in the Kiev region, our soldiers found many corpses of civilians, as well as traces of robberies and rapes of our citizens. Photos of the city's wounded population are spreading across the web at great speed. In total, more than 90 corpses have been found so far, most of the bodies have traces of violent death. We can use what happened for the information war against Russia. Make it so that the whole world believes that we are at war not with a "civilized country", but with the Finno-Mongolian horde of savages. Or maybe it is better not to exaggerate the scale and number of deaths?"

This event is critical to our situation in the south of the country, since with a possible retreat of our troops, we will not be able to blow up the bridge, which will help the Russian troops to cross the Dnieper. Conscript detachments were hastily created in the nearest settlements. Our fighters will fight to the last, Slava Ukraini!"

As they did a year ago after the arrest of Alexei Navalny and subsequent mass rallies across the country, the Russian police and Rosgvardiya are acting with extreme violence.

news.49.d: "Since the beginning of October 2021, various media outlets have reported that the Russian Federation may be preparing an invasion of the territory of Ukraine, which caused a crisis in Russian-Ukrainian relations, as well as the wariness of Western countries. As a result, this led to a series of diplomatic actions on the part of Russia and Western countries, as well as to initial negotiations, which, however, did not have any significant success. Russia was reluctant to act in the political space, and some of the demands looked like nothing more than an attempt to delay the negotiations, or disrupt them. However, unexpectedly for everyone, Vladimir Putin and Sergey Lavrov proposed to convene a summit to discuss the conflict over Ukraine, calling on Western countries to "ensure justice" and "protect peace." In response to this, the United States, Great Britain and Ukraine sent a note of consent to participate in this event, although it was not without speculative statements from both sides of the conflict. Many international and national media dubbed this event as an unexpected detente and the likely end of the crisis, but analysts urge not to rush to conclusions — given Russian rhetoric, as well as the ultimatum of Western countries about some points of Russia's early claims, the summit may have absolutely unpredictable consequences, and it is too early to talk about the end of the crisis."

che.1.desc: "The Republic of Chechnya is a republic of the Russian Federation located in the North Caucasus. The republic is inhabited mainly by Chechens, as well as other ethnic groups, including Russians, Georgians and Armenians.\n Ramzan Akhmatovich Kadyrov, a member of the Kadyrov family, who have been in power in the region for more than 20 years, still remains in power in Chechnya. The irremovability of the rulers in the republic has made itself felt, all the state institutions of Chechnya are completely obedient to Kadyrov personally, and the Kadyrov family itself has its own army of mercenaries. However, the economy of the Republic is still completely dependent on the federal center, all cash flows are controlled by the Kremlin, and this whole game of autonomy, both on the part of the head of the Republic and the Russian Federation, causes some concern. In addition, Chechnya has a number of problems, including corruption, human rights violations, religious and cultural discrimination.\n It is in this state of affairs that the unstable Chechen Republic is approaching an equally unstable period of time. While the clouds are gathering over the CIS, Chechnya still remains a toy in the hands of the Kadyrovs and the federal government."

che.3.t: "Cult of personality around the Kadyrovs"
che.3.desc: "The people of Chechnya have always been selflessly devoted to their leaders, but to no one as much as Akhmat and Ramzan Kadyrov. The first president and actually the creator of modern Chechnya is Akhmat Kadyrov, the father of the current head of the republic, Ramzan Kadyrov. He played a major role in the victory of the federal troops in the Second Chechen War. Becoming the first head of post-war Chechnya, he did a lot to restore peace in the republic. For which he paid with his life. In 2004, Akhmat Kadyrov died in a terrorist attack in Grozny. Chechen terrorists took responsibility for his murder headed by Shamil Basayev. After the death of his father, Ramzan Kadyrov became the new president of the republic. Shortly after, the mass hanging of portraits of Akhmat in state and public institutions of Chechnya began, and in 2005 a monument was erected to him on the central square of Grozny.\n Now "The Cult of Personality” also remains strong, the flags of Chechnya often depict Ramzan or Akhmat, and the Chechen special forces bear the name of Kadyrov the father."
